Missed opportunities for improvement rose not merely from bad\n\t\t\t\t\tluck but from knowing too little vital information about the other. 40 years\n\t\t\t\t\tafter the Iranian revolution, we have still lots to learn about this complex\n\t\t\t\t\tinterrelation.\n\t\t\t\t</Typography>\n\n\t\t\t\t<Typography type=\"body1\">\n\t\t\t\t\tTo address this knowledge gap <Link to=\"/\">John Tirman</Link>,{' '}\n\t\t\t\t\t<Link to=\"/\">Malcolm Byrne</Link> and <Link to=\"/\">Hussein Banai </Link> have\n\t\t\t\t\tapproached this relationship in an unusual way. They conducted several “critical\n\t\t\t\t\toral history” conferences, where they brought together policymakers from several\n\t\t\t\t\tcountries, mainly Iran and the United States but also others, involved\n\t\t\t\t\tparticularly in negotiations from Britain, France, and Italy. In various\n\t\t\t\t\tsessions, they interviewed key players and absorbed contemporary scholarship to\n\t\t\t\t\tidentify hidden perspectives and missed opportunities.\n\t\t\t\t</Typography>\n\n\t\t\t\t<Typography type=\"body1\">\n\t\t\t\t\tAs a basis for the conversation, they provided a collection of documents\n\t\t\t\t\tprocured through Freedom of Information Act requests and open-source documents,\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch as published interviews, analyses, memoirs, and more. This archive of\n\t\t\t\t\tdocuments is the bulk of what is now accessible on this platform.\n\t\t\t\t</Typography>\n\n\t\t\t\t<Typography type=\"body1\">\n\t\t\t\t\tFor it to be accessible to other scholars and the public, a digital presence has\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen developed. Hidden Perspectives is the result of this development. It is an\n\t\t\t\t\tattempt to create a framework to explore the material and deep dive into\n\t\t\t\t\tspecific historical contexts.\n\t\t\t\t</Typography>\n\n\t\t\t\t<Typography type=\"h4\">The Digital Archive</Typography>\n\n\t\t\t\t<Typography type=\"body1\">\n\t\t\t\t\tThe digital archive consists of 560 documents, dating from 1971 to 2012. Those\n\t\t\t\t\thave been summarized and enhanced with additional metadata. Furthermore, a\n\t\t\t\t\tthousand event entries ranging from 1975 to 1999 extend the dataset.\n\t\t\t\t</Typography>\n\t\t\t\t<Typography type=\"body1\">\n\t\t\t\t\tIn order to uncover patterns within the archive and to contextualize individual\n\t\t\t\t\tdocuments and events, connections were made. We also used the process called\n\t\t\t\t\tnamed entity extraction to identify protagonists involved in the dataset. While\n\t\t\t\t\tthe dataset might contain human biases and automation mistakes, it served as an\n\t\t\t\t\tinitial foundation for further investigation and will be improved in the long\n\t\t\t\t\trun. Ultimately, those connected entries were visualized in an interactive\n\t\t\t\t\tdigital archive that provides an elegant way to access and explore the delicate\n\t\t\t\t\tconnection between the two countries.\n\t\t\t\t</Typography>\n\t\t\t</OuterRow>\n\t\t\t<FeatureWrapper>\n\t\t\t\t{features.map(feature => (\n\t\t\t\t\t<Feature />\n\t\t\t\t))}\n\t\t\t</FeatureWrapper>\n\t\t</Wrapper>\n\t)\n}\n\nexport default Index\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AASA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAEA;AADA;AAIA;AADA;AACA;AAIA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AASA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAWA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AADA;AAMA;AACA;AACA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
